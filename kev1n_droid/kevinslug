When the McAllister family accidentally leaves headstrong youngster Kevin behind on vacation, he thinks it's a wish come true. But two bumbling burglars plan on robbing the house on Christmas Eve, and they aren't going to let an eight-year-old stop them. As Kevin's mom rushes home from Paris, he concocts a labyrinth of holiday-style booby traps to defend his turf. With the help of strangers, neighbors, and the Polka King of the Midwest, Kevin and his family just might pull off a merry Christmas. Featuring Macaulay Culkin in a career-defining role and John Candy in a cameo that steals the show.
